# Dask at CHTC Demo

This repository holds the demo materials for my "Dask at CHTC" demo for the 
Morgridge Research Computing Virtual Brown Bag Lunch on 2020-06-25. 
It's a "vision of a possible future" of what using Dask on the CHTC pool
might look like.

This is very much a prototype, and you shouldn't try it at home:
there's a lot
of hacking going on in the cluster infrastructure to make it work, 
which we'd like to clean up.

The accompanying introductory slides are
